## Motivation
The project use dataset from UCI machine learnning repository. We think the project is interesting and meaningful, because building a 
forest classificaction model has significant effect on enviroment pretection and geography mapping. The output (forest type map) can be used to identify and/or quantify the ecosystem services (e.g. carbon storage, erosion protection) provided by the forest.

## Data Source
We derived our dataset from UCI machine learnning repository.

## Data Summary Statistic
This data set contains 523 samples from a remote sensing study which mapped different forest types based on their spectral characteristics
at visible-to-near infrared wavelengths, using ASTER satellite imagery. 
Here is an example of our dataset:
