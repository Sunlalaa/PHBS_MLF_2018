## Introduction
We use machine learning algorithms to categorize tree species, based on their color index on satellite images taken in September, March and May. This project uses a dataset made available by **UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository**. We think the project is interesting and meaningful, because the output (forest type map) can be used to identify and/or quantify ecosystem services (e.g.: carbon storage, erosion protection) provided by the forest, which has significant effect on environment protection.

## Data Source
We derived our dataset from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

## Data Summary Statistics
This dataset contains 523 samples and 27 features from a remote sensing study which mapped different forest types based on their spectral characteristics at visible-to-near infrared wavelengths, using ASTER satellite imagery of an area in Japan.
Here is an example of our dataset:

**The attributes contain information on the following:**

* Sï¼šSugi forest
* h: Hinoki forest
* d: Mixed deciduous forest
* o: Other non forest land
* b1 - b9: ASTER image bands containing spectral information in the green, red, and near infrared wavelengths for three dates (Sept. 26, 2010; March 19, 2011; May 08, 2011.)
* pred_minus_obs_S_b1 - pred_minus_obs_S_b9: Predicted spectral values (based on spatial interpolation) minus actual spectral values for the 's' class (b1-b9)
* pred_minus_obs_H_b1 - pred_minus_obs_H_b9: Predicted spectral values (based on spatial interpolation) minus actual spectral values for the 'h' class (b1-b9)		

## Our project approach:
* Visualize the data with Seaborn
* Feature selection / dimension reduction
* Support Vector Machine
* Neural network
* performance comparison
